My primary research interest is investigating information technology from the perspective of Anglo-American political philosophy and liberal theories of distributive justice. I have published research papers on free software, intellectual property rights, Internet regulation, doxing, Internet research ethics, and AI ethics.

I am currently a research scientist with the CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, where I work on responsible innovation in new and emerging technologies. I joined the CSIRO in 2019 as a postdoctoral fellow working on responsible innovation in robotics and AI.

During 2015 and 2016 I was a postdoctoral researcher with the Department of Philosophy and ethics advisor within the Centre for Telematics and Information Technology (CTIT) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I also worked on the EU FP7 [SATORI (Stakeholders Acting Together On the ethical impact assessment of Research and Innovation)](http://satoriproject.eu/) project. 

I completed a PhD in philosophy at the University of Queensland in November 2011. My thesis presented a framework describing the rights and duties various stakeholders may have over computer software, and examined the arguments for and against granting users specific rights over the software they use.
