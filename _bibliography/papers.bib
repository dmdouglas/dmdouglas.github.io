I suggest that the Separation Principle can be further justified by appealing to Michael Walzer's concept of complex equality. In this analysis, the integrated control of communication infrastructure and control over who can use it is unjust as the influence of the infrastructure sphere is influencing the sphere of expression. This gives a further theoretical justification for Wu’s Separation Principle and for resisting the monopolisation of information networks.},

	doi = {10.1007/s11948-010-9224-4},
	abstract = {Software ownership allows the owner to restrict the distribution of software and to prevent others from reading the software’s source code and building upon it. However, free software is released to users under software licenses that give them the right to read the source code, modify it, reuse it, and distribute the software to others. Proponents of free software such as Richard M. Stallman and Eben Moglen argue that the social disutility of software ownership is a sufficient justification for prohibiting it. This social disutility includes the social instability of disregarding laws and agreements covering software use and distribution, inequality of software access, and the inability to help others by sharing software with them. Here I consider these and other social disutility claims against withholding specific software rights from users, in particular, the rights to read the source code, duplicate, distribute, modify, imitate, and reuse portions of the software within new programs. I find that generally while withholding these rights from software users does cause some degree of social disutility, only the rights to duplicate, modify and imitate cannot legitimately be denied to users on this basis. The social disutility of withholding the rights to distribute the software, read its source code and reuse portions of it in new programs is insufficient to prohibit software owners from denying them to users. A compromise between the software owner and user can minimise the social disutility of withholding these particular rights from users. However, the social disutility caused by software patents is sufficient for rejecting such patents as they restrict the methods of reducing social disutility possible with other forms of software ownership.},

	abstract = {Like the ownership of physical property, the issues computer software ownership raises can be understood as concerns over how various rights and duties over software are shared between owners and users. The powers of software owners are defined in software licenses, the legal agreements defining what users can and cannot do with a particular program. To help clarify how these licenses permit and restrict users’ actions, here I present a conceptual framework of software rights and duties that is inspired by the terms of various proprietary, open source, and free software licenses. To clarify the relationships defined by these rights and duties, this framework distinguishes between software creators (the original developer), custodians (those who can control its use), and users (those who utilise the software). I define the various rights and duties that can be shared between these parties and how these rights and duties relate to each other. I conclude with a brief example of how this framework can be used by defining the concepts of free software and copyleft in terms of rights and duties.},

	abstract = {Doxing is the intentional public release onto the Internet of personal information about an individual by a third party, often with the intent to humiliate, threaten, intimidate, or punish the identified individual. In this paper I present a conceptual analysis of the practice of doxing and how it differs from other forms of privacy violation. I distinguish between three types of doxing: deanonymizing doxing, where personal information establishing the identity of a formerly anonymous individual is released; targeting doxing, that discloses personal information that reveals specific details of an individual’s circumstances that are usually private, obscure, or obfuscated; and delegitimizing doxing, which reveals intimate personal information that damages the credibility of that individual. I also describe how doxing differs from blackmail and defamation. I argue that doxing may be justified in cases where it reveals wrongdoing (such as deception), but only if the information released is necessary to reveal that such wrongdoing has occurred and if it is in the public interest to reveal such wrongdoing. Revealing additional information, such as that which allows an individual to be targeted for harassment and intimidation, is unjustified. I illustrate my discussion with the examples of the alleged identification of the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, by Newsweek magazine, the identification of the notorious Reddit user Violentacrez by the blog Gawker, and the harassment of game developer Zoe Quinn in the ‘GamerGate’ Internet campaign.},

	doi = {10.1108/JICES-09-2016-0033},
	abstract = {Purpose:
This paper examines whether there are morally defensible reasons for using or operating websites (called ‘booters’) that offer Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on a specified target to users for a price. Booters have been linked to some of the most powerful DDoS attacks in recent years. 

Design/methodology/approach: 
The authors identify the various parties associated with booter websites and the means through which booters operate. Then the authors present and evaluate the two arguments that they claim may be used to justify operating and using booters: that they are a useful tool for testing the ability of networks and servers to handle heavy traffic, and that they may be used to perform DDoS attacks as a form of civil disobedience on the Internet. 

Findings: 
The authors argue that the characteristics of existing booters disqualify them from being morally justified as network stress testing tools or as a means of performing civil disobedience. The use of botnets that include systems without the permission of their owners undermines the legitimacy of both justifications. While a booter that does not use any third-party systems without permission might in principle be justified under certain conditions, the authors argue that it is unlikely that any existing booters meet these requirements. 

Practical implications: 
Law enforcement agencies may use the arguments presented here to justify shutting down the operation of booters, and so reduce the number of DDoS attacks on the Internet. 

Originality/value: 
The value of this work is in critically examining the potential justifications for using and operating booter websites and in further exploring the ethical aspects of using DDoS attacks as a form of civil disobedience.},

I argue that it is a defensible means of combating hate speech if it has the purpose of beginning a process of deradicalizing the identified individuals through reintegrative shaming. Such doxing must be motivated by a legitimate social need (in that they can be justified using premises and evidence acceptable to all in society),and must remain within socially tolerable bounds (in that it does not lead to physical harm, it is not indiscriminate, and is in response to injustices that are in principle recognisable to those who are not affected by it).

Rawls’ theory uses the hypothetical scenario of people deliberating about the justice of social institutions from the ‘original position’ as a method of removing bias in decision-making about justice. The original position imposes a ‘veil of ignorance’ that hides the particular circumstances of individuals from them so that they will not be influenced by self-interest. I adapt Rawls’ methodology by introducing an abstract description of information technology to those deliberating about justice from within the original position. This abstract description focuses on information devices that users can use to access information (and which may record information about them as well) and information networks that information devices use to communicate. The abstractness of this description prevents the particular characteristics of the Internet and the computing devices in use from influencing the decisions about the just use and regulation of information technology and networks. From this abstract position, the principles of justice that the participants accept for the rest of society will also apply to the computing devices people use to communicate, and to Internet regulation.},

Introducing these systems into the design process risks creating a ‘responsibility gap’ for flaws in the products they are used to create, as human designers may no longer believe that they are wholly responsible for them. We respond to this problem by distinguishing between causal responsibility and capacity responsibility (the ability to be morally responsible for actions) for creating product designs to argue that while the computational design systems and human designers are both casually responsible for creating product designs, the human designers who use these systems and the developers who create them have capacity responsibility for such designs. We show that there is no responsibility gap for products designed using computational design systems by comparing different accounts of moral responsibility for robots and AI (instrumentalism, machine ethics, and hybrid responsibility). We argue that all three of these accounts of moral responsibility for AI systems support the conclusion that the product designers who use computational design systems and the developers of these systems are morally responsible for any flaws or faults in the products designed by these systems.

	abstract = {An emerging use of machine learning (ML) is creating products optimised using computational design for individual users and produced using 3D printing. One potential application is bespoke surgical tools optimised for specific patients. While optimised tool designs benefit patients and surgeons, there is the risk that computational design may also create unexpected designs that are unsuitable for use with potentially harmful consequences. We interviewed potential stakeholders to identify both established and unique technical risks associated with the use of computational design for surgical tool design and applied ethical risk analysis (eRA) to identify how stakeholders might be exposed to ethical risk within this process. The main findings of this research are twofold. First, distinguishing between unique and established risks for new medical technologies helps identify where existing methods of risk mitigation may be applicable to a surgical innovation, and where new means of mitigating risks may be needed. Second, the value of distinguishing between technical and ethical risks in such a system is that it identifies the key responsibilities for managing these risks and allows for any potential interdependencies between stakeholders in managing these risks to be made explicit. The approach demonstrated in this paper may be applied to understanding the implications of new AI and ML applications in healthcare and other high consequence domains.},

	abstract = {Computational design uses artificial intelligence (AI) to optimise designs towards user-determined goals. When combined with 3D printing, it is possible to develop and construct physical products in a wide range of geometries and materials and encapsulating a range of functionality, with minimal input from human designers. One potential application is the development of bespoke surgical tools, whereby computational design optimises a tool’s morphology for a specific patient’s anatomy and the requirements of the surgical procedure to improve surgical outcomes. This emerging application of AI and 3D printing provides an opportunity to examine whether new technologies affect the ethical responsibilities of those operating in high-consequence domains such as healthcare. This research draws on stakeholder interviews to identify how a range of different professions involved in the design, production, and adoption of computationally designed surgical tools, identify and attribute responsibility within the different stages of a computationally designed tool’s development and deployment. Those interviewed included surgeons and radiologists, fabricators experienced with 3D printing, computational designers, healthcare regulators, bioethicists, and patient advocates. Based on our findings, we identify additional responsibilities that surround the process of creating and using these tools. Additionally, the responsibilities of most professional stakeholders are not limited to individual stages of the tool design and deployment process, and the close collaboration between stakeholders at various stages of the process suggests that collective ethical responsibility may be appropriate in these cases. The role responsibilities of the stakeholders involved in developing the process to create computationally designed tools also change as the technology moves from research and development (R\&D) to approved use.},

Its primary aims have been to comprehensively identify and analyse the present and potential future ethical issues in relation to: (1) the AI and robotics subfields, techniques, approaches and methods; (2) their physical technological products and procedures that are designed for practical applications; and (3) the particular uses and applications of these products and procedures. In conducting the ethical analysis, we strove to provide ample clarification, details about nuances, and contextualisation of the ethical issues that were identified, while avoiding the making of moral judgments and proposing of solutions to these issues.

A secondary aim of this report has been to convey the results of SIENNA’s “country studies” of the national academic and popular media debate on the ethical issues in AI and robotics in twelve different EU and non-EU countries, highlighting the similarities and differences between these countries. While these country study results have only formed a minor contribution to the overall identification and analysis of the ethical issues in this report, they are expected to play a larger role in future SIENNA deliverables.

This deliverable also provides an overview of the history and state of the art of the academic debate on ethics of AI and robot ethics, and an overview of the current institutional support of these fields.},

AI systems should be recognised as socio-technical systems, where the people involved in designing, developing, deploying, and using the system are as important as the system for determining whether it is trustworthy.

	abstract = {Most of the literature on using machine learning (ML) systems in criminal investigations concerns whether using these systems undermines public trust in law enforcement. A related concern is whether investigators themselves should trust these systems. But what do we really mean by ‘trust’? Many methods have been developed for promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability in the predictions made by ML systems, however a technical approach to these problems needs to be accompanied by a human centred approach to user trust. In order to address social, ethical and practical issues these systems need to present information in such a way that the people that use them can make balanced decisions on whether or not they should trust them. In this report we use the lens of user experience (UX) and social science to look at how the role responsibilities and accountability of criminal justice experts may be affected by the use of ML systems in criminal investigations. How will these systems be used by these experts and what is the effect that may have in this regulated and legislated environment? To understand this, we explore the concepts of responsibility, accountability and transparency in the context of criminal investigations in parallel to the various levels of automation and AI assistance ranging from full human control to full automation. We discuss why ML systems used in criminal investigations can be considered ‘human-in-the-loop’ forms of automation, where the systems offer decision support to users. We also explore the issues connected with calibrating trust in an ML system, describing the characteristics of automated systems that affect the ability of users to determine if their trust in a system is legitimate, and the risks of misusing, rejecting, and abusing automation by experts operating in criminal justice settings. We highlight the risks connected with using ML systems, and how these risks might affect the use of these systems in criminal justice contexts. The report summarises additional areas of responsibility across the ecosystem of machine learning systems in a criminal context including: the responsibility of law enforcement institutions to train their workforce in the skills needed to use data and insights from ML systems; the responsibility of specific departments in these organisations to examine the intended use of such systems, adjusting their internal policies accordingly and ensuring their employees are alert to how this affects their responsibility or accountability; and the responsibility of technologists to be transparent about the system’s trustworthiness, and to allow experts to accurately calibrate their trust in the system by closely observing and responding to how they interpret and use different types of predictive data in investigative processes.},

       year = {2011},
       abstract = {Software ownership significantly affects the users of information technology as it allows owners to withhold rights from users and also impose duties upon them. This thesis evaluates this ownership by determining the rights and duties users should hold by using a conceptual framework of rights and duties over software to evaluate the major arguments for and against software ownership. I begin by describing the relevant aspects of software and the intellectual property laws covering it, and the software licenses defining the rights and duties of software users. I distinguish between three groups of people associated with any software project: creators (those who write the software), custodians (those who control the rights and duties others have over the software), and users (those who use the software). These classifications are used to define a set of rights and duties that these groups may possess over a particular program. The major categories of software ownership (such as the public domain, free software, open source, freeware, shareware, and retail software) are described in terms on this framework. I use this framework to determine the particular rights creators and custodians can justifiably withhold from users based on the three arguments most frequently given for why software creators should have greater control over the software they develop. These arguments claim that the creator’s labour in developing her software grants her an entitlement to claim ownership over it (the labour entitlement argument), that the creator deserves to own her program as a reward for developing it (the desert argument), and that granting ownership to creators is the most effective incentive for encouraging software development (the consequentialist incentive argument). I then examine the three major arguments for giving users greater control over software to determine the particular rights and duties that these arguments require users to possess. These arguments are that software ownership causes an unjustified social harm (the social disutility argument), that granting users more rights over software improves software quality (the open source argument), and that users need greater control over the software they use to protect their autonomy (the liberty argument). After evaluating these arguments, I conclude by comparing the different bundles of rights and duties each argument grants users to determine if there is any agreement between them over the particular rights and duties that should be granted to users and which rights creators and custodians can legitimately withhold from them. Finally, I compare the rights and duties that various kinds of software licenses grant users and determine whether they grant users the bundle of rights and duties that are justified by the arguments discussed.},

      abstract = {While the operationalisation of high-level AI ethics principles into practical AI/ML systems has made progress, there is still a theory-practice gap in managing tensions between the underlying AI ethics aspects. We cover five approaches for addressing the tensions via trade-offs, ranging from rudimentary to complex. The approaches differ in the types of considered context, scope, methods for measuring contexts, and degree of justification. None of the approaches is likely to be appropriate for all organisations, systems, or applications. To address this, we propose a framework which consists of: (i) proactive identification of tensions, (ii) prioritisation and weighting of ethics aspects, (iii) justification and documentation of trade-off decisions. The proposed framework aims to facilitate the implementation of well-rounded AI/ML systems that are appropriate for potential regulatory requirements. },

      abstract = {Countries around the world are prioritising net zero emissions to meet their Paris Agreement goals. The demand for social impact assessment (SIA) is likely to grow as this transition will require investments in decarbonisation projects with speed and at scale. There will be winners and losers of these projects because not everyone benefits the same; and hence, trade-offs are inevitable. SIAs, therefore, should focus on understanding how the risks and benefits will be distributed among and within stakeholders and sectors and enable the identification of trade-offs that are just and fair. In this study, we used a hypothetical case of large-scale hydrogen production in regional Australia and engaged with multi-disciplinary experts to identify justice issues in transitioning to such an industry. Using Rawlsian theory of justice as fairness, we identified several tensions between different groups (national, regional, local, inter and intra-communities) and sectors (environmental and economic) concerning the establishment of a hydrogen industry. These stakeholders and sectors will be disproportionately affected by this establishment. We argue that Rawlsian principles of justice would enable the practice of SIA to identify justice trade-offs. Further, we conceptualise that a systems approach will be critical to facilitate a wider participation, and an agile process for achieving just trade-offs in SIA.},

      abstract = {The term 'ethical risk' often appears in discussions about the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). However, ethical risk remains inconsistently defined in this context, obscuring what distinguishes it from other forms of risk, such as social, reputational or legal risk, for example. In this paper we present a definition of ethical risk for AI as being any risk associated with an AI that may cause stakeholders to fail one or more of their ethical responsibilities towards other stakeholders. To support our definition, we describe how stakeholders have role responsibilities that follow from their relationship with the AI, and that these responsibilities are towards other stakeholders associated with the AI. We discuss how stakeholders may differ in their ability to make decisions about an AI, their exposure to risk, and whether they or others may benefit from these risks. Stakeholders without the ability to make decisions about the risks associated with an AI and how it is used are dependent on other stakeholders with this ability. This relationship places those who depend on decision-making stakeholders at ethical risk of being dominated by them. The decision-making stakeholder is ethically responsible for the risks their decisions about the AI impose on those affected by them. We illustrate our account of ethical risk for AI with two examples: AI-designed attachments for surgical robots that are optimised for treating specific patients, and self-driving 'robotaxis' that carry passengers on public roads.},

This study contributes to that vision by identifying potential quantum applications across Australian industries. Through an extensive literature review – encompassing government reports, market analyses, academic publications, and insights from the quantum industry – this study provides a comprehensive snapshot of potential use cases for quantum technologies across Australia’s economic landscape. This initial analysis serves as a foundational step in assessing quantum readiness across Australian industries. By identifying promising quantum applications and their potential impact, it aims to inform strategic planning for quantum readiness, guiding key stakeholders within the Australian Quantum Ecosystem, including government, quantum technology end-users, and the quantum technology developers.},
