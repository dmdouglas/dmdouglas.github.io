I completed a PhD in philosophy at the University of Queensland in November 2011. My thesis {% cite douglas2011software %} presented a framework describing the rights and duties various stakeholders may have over computer software, and examined the arguments for and against granting users specific rights over the software they use.

I published two papers based on thesis chapters. 'A Bundle of Software Rights and Duties' {% cite douglas_bundle_2011 %} presented the framework of property rights and duties that describes the various ways software may be used by three types of stakeholders: users, developers, and custodians. 'The Social Distuility of Software Ownership' {% cite douglas_social_2011 %} is based on the thesis chapter that examines the arguments against software ownership based on the social costs of withholding rights from users.
