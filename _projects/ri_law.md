In 2019 and 2020 I contributed to a CSIRO report {%cite ibarra2020machine %} on how machine learning systems may be designed so that expert users in law enforcement (such as investigators) will have an appropriate level of trust in them. This report may be found here: <a href="https://publications.csiro.au/publications/publication/PIcsiro:EP205485">Machine Learning and Responsibility in Criminal Investigation</a>.

The official project page can be found here: <a href="https://research.csiro.au/ri/trust-in-machine-learning-and-law-enforcement/">Trust in Machine Learning and Law Enforcement</a>.

This report was also featured on CSIRO's Data61 website: <a href=
"https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/Articles/2020/November/designing-trustworthy-machine-learning-systems">The Journey Towards Understanding User Trust and How to Design Trustworthy Systems (Data61)</a>.
