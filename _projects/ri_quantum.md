Beginning in 2023, I was part of a team of researchers investigationg how Australian industry sectors were preparing for the introduction of second-generation quantum technologies: quantum communications, quantum computing, and quantum sensing. This work began with a survey of the literature to identify the potential use cases for these technologies. This survey has now been released {%cite baruwal2024mapping}. We also interviewed representatives of Australian industry sectors for their perspective, and are working on a wider survey of Australian industries on their awareness and preparations for quantum technologies.
