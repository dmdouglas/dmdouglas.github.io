From 2019 to 2022, I was part of a research project at the CSIRO investigating how stakeholders understood ethical responsibility for AI-designed surgical tools that would be attached to surgical robots. So far this project has produced three papers: a theoretical paper examining how ethical responsibility should be determined for physical products designed by generative AI (and in particular, evolutionary algorithms) {%cite douglas_moral_2021 %}; a paper examining stakeholders' views on ethical responsibility for AI-designed surgical tools {%cite douglas_ethical_2022 %}; and a paper examining stakeholder's views on the ethical risks of using AI-designed surgical tools {%cite douglas_ethical_2023 %}. The insights we gained from this project also led to our account of ethical risk for AI {%cite douglas2024ethical %}.

This project was also my first work using qualitative research methods.

The official project page can be found here: [Responsibility for Bespoke 3D Printed Surgical Robots (CSIRO)](https://research.csiro.au/ri/responsibility-for-bespoke-3d-printed-surgical-robots/).

I was also interviewed for the CSIRO Responsible Innovation Future Science Platform blog about this project: [Who Bears Responsibility When AI Systems Go Wrong? (CSIRO)](https://research.csiro.au/ri/responsibility-ai-tools/).
