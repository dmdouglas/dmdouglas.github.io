[SATORI (Stakeholders Acting Together On the ethical impact assessment of Research and Innovation)](http://satoriproject.eu/) was a four-year EU project to develop a common European framework for the ethical assessment of research and innovation activity. I contributed to the project during my time with the University of Twente in 2015 and 2016.
