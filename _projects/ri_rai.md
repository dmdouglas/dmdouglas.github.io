From 2020 to 2023, I was part of a multidisciplinary research project at the CSIRO investigating how AI ethics principles are used in practice by the developers and users of AI systems {%cite sanderson_towards_2022 %}, {%cite sanderson_towards_2022}, {%cite  sanderson_ai_2023 %}, {%cite sanderson_towards_2022 %}. Insights from interviews with researchers who develop or use AI in their work was used to inform the development of a set of design patterns AI developers can use to develop responsible AI systems. As part of this broad project, I conducted research interviews, helped to analyse the interview transcripts, and contributed to the published papers. 

I also contributed to conceptual work on what 'trust' means in the context of AI {%cite duenser_who_2023 %}. I also contributed to further work that investigated how AI ethics principles can be used in practice {%cite lu2022software %}, {%cite sanderson2023implementing %}, {%cite sanderson2024resolving %}.
