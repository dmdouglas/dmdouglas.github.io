In 2023 and 2024, I was part of a team who organised and ran a workshop at the 2024 Australian Planetary Science Meeting held in Brisbane. The purpose of this workshop was to bring together Australia's planetary and space science community to discuss future objections for these sciences in Australia. The workshop design is intended to be repeatable in future years to allow these goals to be revised in future.
