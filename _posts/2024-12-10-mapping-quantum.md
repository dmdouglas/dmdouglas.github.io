We have now released the first output of the Quantum Readiness report. In {%cite baruwal2024mapping %}, we present the results of our literature survey on the potential use cases for quantum technologies that are described in government strategies, industry documents, market analyses, and academic publications. 

I presented this report at i-SAIRAS (International Symposium on Artifical Intelligence, Robotics and Automation in Space) 2024, which was held in Brisbane on November 19-21.
