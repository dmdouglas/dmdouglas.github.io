In this paper I examine Jeremy Benthamâ€™s arguments in favour of patents in light of his description of the five harms associated with monopolies. I find while these harms can be reduced by the limited duration and specific definition of patents, the existence of these harms means that a utilitarian (like Bentham) would have to support an alternative to patents if it produced the same positive results without the monopoly harms.
