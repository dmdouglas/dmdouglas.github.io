This commentary responds to the primary article by Aste Corbridge in the _UniSA Student Law Review_ (2017/2018) entitled ‘Responding to Doxing in Australia: Towards a Right to Informational Self-Determination?’. It discusses the way that concepts of ‘personal information’ and ‘identification information’ from the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) correspond with the seven crucial types of identity knowledge identified by Gary T. Marx and argues that these statutory definitions should be expanded to offer better protection to victims of doxing in Australia.
