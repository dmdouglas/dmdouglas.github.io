I'm a co-author with some of my CSIRO colleagues on energy justice. In ["Just Trade-Offs in a Net-Zero Transition and Social Impact Assessment"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925524000933) {%cite malakar2024just %}, we explain how Rawls' theory of distributive justice may be used as part of a social impact assessment for introducing new energy technologies. It's published in the journal _Environmental Impact Assessment Review_, and the paper is open access.
