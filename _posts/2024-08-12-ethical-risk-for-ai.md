A new paper that builds on the insights we gained from my postdoctoral research on responsiblity and surgical robotics has been published. In {%cite douglas2024ethical %}, my co-authors (Justine Lacey and David Howard) and I present an account of ethical risk for AI. It appears in the journal _AI & Ethics_ and is open access.

I presented a earlier version of this paper at the 2023 Forum on Philosophy, Engineering and Technology held at TUDelft in the Netherlands in April 2023.
